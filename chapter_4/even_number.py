#printing out the value in a range, this time with a set increment

even_numbers = list(range(2,11,2))
print(even_numbers)

#A list will be created with value between 2 and 10. The third argument in range is the value of the increment to be followed.
#The program will go though the value of 2 to 10 in increments of 2
